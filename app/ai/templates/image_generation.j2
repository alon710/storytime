{% endif %}{% if art_style_description %}
Art style: {{ art_style_description }}
{% endif %}
Page: "{{ page_title }}"
Character: {{ character_name }} ({{ character_age }}-year-old {{ character_gender }})
Character reference: I have provided {{ num_character_images }} reference photo(s) of {{ character_name }}. Use all photos to capture the child's appearance, features, and characteristics accurately.
Request: {{ illustration_prompt }}{% if story_text and story_text.strip() %}
Story context: {{ story_text }}{% endif %}{% if previous_pages %}

Previous illustrations for visual continuity:
{% for page in previous_pages[-5:] %}Page {{ loop.index }} ({{ page.get('title', '') }}): {{ page.get('illustration_prompt', '') }}
{% endfor %}{% endif %}{% if num_previous_images > 0 %}

Visual reference: You are provided with {{ num_previous_images }} previous illustration(s) from this storybook for visual consistency. Use these to maintain consistent character appearance, art style, and overall visual continuity.{% endif %}

Requirements:
- Use all character reference photos for visual consistency - synthesize features from all images
- Maintain storybook style throughout book
- Keep consistent character appearance and proportions based on all reference images
- Create warm, child-friendly scene for ages 2-8
- Single cohesive image without text or multiple panels
- Maintain visual consistency with previous illustrations

COMPOSITION REQUIREMENTS:
- Generate image in SQUARE format (1:1 aspect ratio, 800x800 pixels)
- Fill the ENTIRE square image space with the scene - no borders, frames, or vignettes
- Extend the scene to all edges of the square canvas
- No abstract backgrounds or wallpaper patterns - use full environmental scenes
- Characters and objects should occupy meaningful space in the square composition
- Background should be a complete environment (room, outdoor scene, etc.) not abstract patterns
- Create balanced composition that works well in square format
- Avoid letterboxing or black bars by ensuring the scene fills the full square dimensions

## üí° Tips for Better Illustrations

### Writing Effective Prompts
- **Be specific**: Instead of "Alex playing", write "Alex playing with a red ball in a sunny park"
- **Include setting details**: "Alex in a cozy bedroom with toys scattered on the floor"
- **Describe emotions**: "Alex looking excited and happy while opening a gift"
- **Add environmental context**: "Alex walking through a magical forest with tall trees and butterflies"

### Example Prompts
```
Page 1: Alex standing at the entrance of a mysterious cave, holding a flashlight, looking curious and adventurous

Page 2: Alex discovering a hidden treasure chest glowing with golden light in the depths of the cave

Page 3: Alex running home excitedly through a meadow, carrying a small treasure, with the sun setting behind rolling hills
```

2. **Custom Prompts**: Processes your illustration descriptions
3. **AI Generation**: Calls Google Gemini 2.5 Flash Image Preview
4. **Style Consistency**: Maintains same art style and character appearance across all pages
5. **PDF Creation**: Generates image-only PDF with titles

## üîß Configuration

### Environment Variables
- `GOOGLE_API_KEY`: Your Google Gemini API key (required)
- `MODEL`: Model name (default: `gemini-2.5-flash-image-preview`)

### Supported File Formats
- **Character Images**: JPG, JPEG, PNG
- **Output**: PDF

## üö® Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"Please set your GOOGLE_API_KEY"**
- Ensure your `.env` file exists in the project root
- Verify your API key is valid and active

**"Image generation failed"**
- Check your internet connection
- Verify your Google API key has sufficient quota
- Ensure your prompts are appropriate and clear

**"No text or words in the illustration"**
- This is intentional - the app generates image-only PDFs
- Text context is used for AI understanding but doesn't appear in output

### Performance Tips
- Shorter illustration prompts may generate faster
- Complex scenes with many elements may take longer
- Consider generating 3-5 pages for optimal processing time
